# 2. Getting Started
To start with Toungette, just download the library from
packagist with:\
`composer require oviedev/toungette` 
\
\
**NOTE:** you also need to add `"minimum-stability": "rc"` to your `composer.json`. That's
because simplehtmldom doesn't have a stable release yet (at least on packagist), and you
will get an error, while downloading Toungette
\
Now, if you want to translate a single page, create 3 files.
`schem.json`, `index.tounge` and `index.php`.
