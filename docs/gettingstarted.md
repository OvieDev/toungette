# 2. Getting Started
To start with Toungette, just download the library from
packagist with:\
`composer require oviedev/toungette` 
\
\
If you want to use developer versions (or you just get a silly error
about minimum-stability) add `"minimum-stability": "dev"` to your
composer.json.
\
Now, if you want to translate a single page, create 3 files.
`schem.json`, `index.tounge` and `index.php`.
