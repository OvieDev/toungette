# 1. What is Toungette?
Toungette is a simple and small PHP library used to translating websites.
When you're translating page manually, you have to use some complex
tools, which is sometimes a huge problem to learn them.
Of course, you can use Google Chrome's built-in translator, but
its translations are often *weird*.\
Toungette is very simple, and you still have a lot of control over
your translations. You need only 3 files to build stuff
with Toungette. \
